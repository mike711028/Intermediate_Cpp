# What is Class Scope?
When we discuss scope in the context of classes, we are referring to the names of member 
variables and member functions found within the class definition.  The scope of a class 
within a namespace or program file is not covered in this topic.

Within a class, **all of the member variables and functions are available to the class's functions**. 
Note that the members of a class can have access modifiers too such as private and public but
that determines their visibility from outside the class.  **All public and private members are 
available within the class to functions inside the class**.

**When accessing the members of a class, you use the object name followed by either a dot operator (.) 
or the arrow member selection operator (->) then the name of the member (variable or function)**. 
Recall that an object is an instantiated instance of a class.  **Any variables declared inside a member
function are local to that function** in the same way as any other function implementation in C++.

Also note that the way you call a class member will differ depending on the type of class member. 
For example, **for accessing static members, you do not use an instance name but rather the class name 
as in Math::Sum() as opposed to Math myMath; and then myMath.Sum()**.

Class scope permits the creation of class level functions and variables that will not conflict with 
functions or variables of the same name in a different class. If we had two different class files
such those shown below, the application knows which Speak() function to call based on the classes instance name.
```cpp
    #include "stdafx.h"
    #include <iostream>
    #include "Person.h"
    
    01 using namespace std;
    02
    03 int main()
    04 {
    05
    06         Person person;
    07         Dog dog;
    08
    09         person.SayHello();    // the same two function names but in different classes
    10         dog.SayHello();
    11
    12         return 0;
    } 
```
Assume that we have two classes called Dog and Person and that the Dog's SayHello() function will output "Woof" 
and the Person's SayHello() function outputs "Hello".  When you call person.SayHello(), the compiler knows which
SayHello function to call because **it is associated with the person object which is an instance of the Person class**. 
Therefore, that SayHello() function will be executed.
 
 By way of example of how to call functions using the different operators, let's consider the Person class 
 that has been used in the Constructors topic, which is recreated here.
 ## Person.h
```cpp
    #pragma once
    
    #include <string>
    
    class Person
    {
    
    private:
        std::string firstName;
        std::string lastName;
    
        int age;
    
    public:
        Person();
    
        Person(std::string fName, std::string lName);
    
        Person(std::string fName, std::string lName, int age);
    
        ~Person();

        void SayHello();
    };
```
 ## Person.cpp
 ```cpp
    #include "stdafx.h"
    #include "Person.h"
    #include <iostream>
    
    Person::Person()
    {
    
    }
    
    Person::Person(std::string fName, std::string lName)
    {
        firstName = fName;
        lastName = lName;
    }
    
    Person::Person(std::string fName, std::string lName, int age)
    {
        firstName = fName;
        lastName = lName;
    
        age = age;
    }
        
    Person::~Person()
    {
    }

    void Person::SayHello
    {
        std::cout << "Hello" << std::endl;
    }
```
As we look at the Person.h and Person.cpp files, we notice that we have three private member variables,
three public constructors, and one public method named SayHello().  To demonstrate the scope of member
variables in a class we have also created the following main.cpp file.
## main.cpp file
```cpp
    #include "stdafx.h"
    #include <iostream>
    #include "Person.h"
    
    01 using namespace std;
    02
    03 int main()
    04 {
    05
    06 // create a Person instance using default constructor
    07 Person *pOne = new Person();
    08
    09 // Create a Person instance using 2 argument constructor
    10 Person *pTwo = new Person("Tom", "Thumb");
    11
    12 // Create a Person instance using 3 argument constructor
    13 Person *pThree = new Person("Tom", "Thumb", 15);
    14
    15 Person p;
    16 
    17 Person &pRef = p;
    18 // class variable method of calling a member function>>>>>1
    19 p.SayHello();
    20
    21 // pointer method of calling a member function>>>>>>>>>>>2
    22 pOne->SayHello();
    23
    24 // reference method of calling a member function>>>>>>>>>3
    25 pRef.SayHello();
    26
    27 return 0;
    } 
```
In this code that makes use of the Person class, we see **different ways of accessing the 
members of the Person class using instantiated objects**.

 On line 07, we dynamically allocate memory for a new Person object called pOne by using a pointer 
 and the new keyword.  We do the same with two other pointers on lines 10 and 13.  The differences
 are that we are **calling different constructors for each one**.  pOne uses the default constructor,
 pTwo uses the 2 argument constructor while pThree uses the 3 argument constructor. Constructors
 have class scope as well as they are declared within the class file.
 
 **On line 15, we create a new Person object called p without using a pointer or the new keyword**.  
 The way that we declare our objects is important for determining how we call the member functions
 or access the public member variables as shown in this code sample. **On line 17 we declare a new reference
 variable that is a reference to the Person object we called p**. We call the SayHello() member function
 on p by using the dot operator on line 19 and that works.  We also **call the SayHello function on line 25 
 using the dot operator and that works as well because we set pRef as a reference to p**.

Note on line 22 however that in order to call the SayHello() function from the dynamically allocated Person 
object called pOne, we had to **use the member selection operator (->) to gain access to the SayHello() function**.
